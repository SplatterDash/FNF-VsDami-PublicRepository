hey look it's splatter using the readme files wooaaahhh

"a#" folders are for main weeks, those show up in the main story mode menu
"b#" folders are for extra weeks, those show up in the extra story mode menu
the "freeplay" folder obviously holds naked people
and the "stage" folder is for the base game stage, yknow, for editors n that kinda stuff

these folders hold the stage files, any sounds specific for the week, and things like that

I'm learning guys I swear




original memo:
-=-=-=-=-=-=-

This is where you should put your week directories for images, sounds and music (not to confuse with "songs").

Examples:
assets/week_assets/week1/
assets/week_assets/weekpsychic/
assets/week_assets/skarlet/

Once compiled, the folders will be moved to assets/ and will look like this:
assets/week1/
assets/weekpsychic/
assets/skarlet/

Check assets/base_game/week7/ for a good example of the file structure
