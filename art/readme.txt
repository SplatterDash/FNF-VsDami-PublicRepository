        DISCLAIMER
#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-

This disclaimer info is shown the very first time you boot up the mod but I'm puttin it here for redundancy sake

Vs. Dami contains flashing lights and rapid camera movements that may trigger epilepsy and/or motion sickness in some players!
If at any point you need to disable them, the options are as follows in the Visuals/UI menu:

- Flashing Lights: "Flashing Lights"
- Camera Movements (including camera zooms that occur every section): "Camera Effects"

Remember you can access the options menu at any time, even when paused during gameplay!

    SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-

why has nobody talked about the system requirements needed for FNF mods smhmh

Vs. Dami can run a consistent 60 FPS minimum on a Windows, Mac, or Linux system (thanks Psych!) without graphic option changes using the following minimum specs:
- CPU: AMD Ryzen 3 5000, Intel Core I3 or similar model (Vs. Dami utilizes multithreading during loading to keep the RAM usage down during gameplay, which is why a strong CPU is recommended)
- GPU: literally anything, even a potato works
- RAM: 2 GB minimum
- Audio: it's a rhythm game dummy OF COURSE you need some way to output audio

While the minimum specs are for best performance, if needed, you can utilize graphics settings to lower the amount of CPU/RAM usage and increase performance/play on lower-end systems, which includes options to disable shaders (Graphics options), antialiasing (Visuals/UI options), and multithreading on loading screens (Graphics options).
There is also an in-depth Low Quality option, which disables a majority of shaders and animated sprites. This setting is located in the Options menu in game, under the Graphics section.

    PERMISSIONS XDDDD
#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-#-

Vanilla FNF permissions:
"Little info, you have FULL PERMISSION to stream, letsplay, meme, shitpost, do WHATEVER you want with the game.
Use the music in videos you do, use art, ANYTHING. GO CRAZY BRO.

If you do make any sort of video, it would be a bro move if you linked the game and spread the word"

Same with Vs. Dami! Feel free to do streams, letsplays, reactions, remixes, dank me me's, and whatever you want. Just don't use our stuff to harass people and you gucci.
It'd be cool though if you include a little credit! Even some links would do nicely.

Something tells me people never read the readme in FNF mods, if you read this comment "I like this mod's bananas" on the GB/GJ page
(we might shout out the first person that does this)

but also have the source code!
https://github.com/SplatterDash/FridayNightFunkin-3D

Like vanilla FNF, Vs. Dami runs on Haxe v4.2.5/HaxeFlixel v5.3.1.
Additional dependencies are included along with instructions on how to install!
